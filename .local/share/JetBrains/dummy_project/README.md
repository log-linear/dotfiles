This file/directory is used as a workaround for running PyCharm while using the Material Shell extension.

By default, running PyCharm via the .desktop entry it (optionally) creates will often lead to it immediately closing the application as it tries to open up the Project startup window. By using the modified .desktop file in .local/share/applications, PyCharm will instead open up this dummy folder, bypassing the startup window altogether
